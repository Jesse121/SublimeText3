OmniMarkupPreviewer v1.7 Changelog:


NOTE:
1. MathJax library was removed during upgrade, because it's located in wrong
   directory so Package Control just remove it. Please hold on until mathjax library
   is installed automatically, if you have set `"mathjax_enabled"` to `true` before.


* Add option `"server_host"` for server listening address.
* Now OmniMarkupPreviewer doesn't require restart on some settings change anymore.
* On demand downloader for mathjax should work under Linux now (using `wget` or `curl`).
* Unsaved textile documents can now be previewed as well.
